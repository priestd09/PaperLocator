Paper locator
=============

[__Paper locator__](http://paperlocator.com) is an easy and universal interface to get immediate access to scientific papers.

Tired of manually extracting *journal*, *volume* and *page* from a reference and searching the publisher websites manually? Paper locator automates this process. Just copy a text sample containing the reference and select if you want to see the abstract (journal website) or the document directly (press enter).
