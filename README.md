Paper locator
=============

Paper locator is an easy and universal interface to get immediate access to scientific papers.

Paste a text sample that contains a reference or citation and Paper locator will try to redirect you immediately to the abstract (click journal website) or the document (press enter).

This automates the whole process of extracting *journal*, *issue* and *page number* from a given reference and searching the publisher websites manually.
